									<h3><strong>Deciphering Surf Forecasts</strong></h3>

									<p>&nbsp;Being adept at interpreting the surf forecast is a critical skill to scoring waves and a point of pride to the initiated. The amount of data on the big surf forecast sites can seem dizzying with all the arrows, numbers and colors. We will break down the basics below so you can start understanding the subtle art.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
									<ul>
									<li><strong> BOUY DATA: </strong>What does it mean when you see the waves are 2-3ft, and then you see "2.1ft @ 6sec" ?&nbsp;<br />&bull; Usually the range numbers&nbsp;eg: 2-3 ft, are an estimate of wave size at the break.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&bull; The number "2.1ft @ 6sec" is the data from an offshore weather-info-collecting bouy. "2.1 ft" is the size of the wave at sea and will translate into a different size depending on the location and tide.&nbsp;"6 sec" indicates the "period". This is the frequency and the higher the better usually. But keep in mind all of these truths are subjective as conditions interact differently with different shorelines, eg: The 16 second Hurricane Fiona swell was too long of a period to work in Rockaway but worked at other breaks on Long island. (<span style="background-color: #ffff00;">7-12sec usually indicates a good period for Rockaway but there can always be ridable waves outside of these parameters.</span>) *You will often see multiple swells at the same location.</li>
									<li><strong>WIND</strong>:&nbsp;Generally, light, offshore wind is ideal; anything else can be hit or miss.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&bull; Offshore means blowing from the land toward the sea, so in Rockaway and most of Long Island that means a North or NW wind. (In New Jersey, offshore wind would be out of the west.)&nbsp;<br />&bull; The mornings tend to be offshore more than afternoon. This is not always the case but it has to do with the temperature difference in the air over the land versus the sea. As the air over the land heats up during the day, this relationship can change, and wind can&nbsp;can&nbsp;suddenly switch.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&bull; Even if the wind direction is not ideal, if it is light enough, there can still be favorable conditions.&nbsp;</li>
									<li><strong>LOCALIZED FACTORS</strong>:&nbsp;There are a number of factors that will be specific to each break to keep in mind.&nbsp;<br />&bull; Tides: Every beach has an ideal tidal range of when the waves work. In Rockaway, this tends to be somewhere in the middle of a *flooding or ebbing tide (*incoming or outgoing). It can be hit or miss when it is very low, and can sometimes not work at all during high tide. This is different for every beach. Keep in mind, the times of the tides move later by about 50 min each day and if there is a full moon, the tide can be bigger than normal, meaning you can experience high tide-like effects at middle tide. Keep tabs on what works and doesn't work at your beach and you will start to see patterns emerge.&nbsp;<br />&bull; Swell Direction: This is indicated by the buoy data usually and can seem a little confusing so to put it simply, this is the direction that the swell is traveling. That direction is good or not so good depending, again, on what works for your specific location. Rockaway likes East or South swells or somewhere in between. Find out what works where you are by checking the local info on the surf forecasting sites and asking around.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
									<li><strong>USE MULTIPLE SOURCES</strong>:&nbsp;<br />&bull; Check multiple surf forecast sites to see what is most accurate for your area or to average out the different forecasts.&nbsp;<br />&bull; Use different weather and wind apps/sites to get accurate and&nbsp;realtime&nbsp;weather info.&nbsp;<br />&bull; Check the National Hurricane Center/NOAA site to keep track of major systems moving in the Atlantic!</li>
